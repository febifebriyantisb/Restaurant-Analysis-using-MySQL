## Project Description
Danny's Diner is a small restaurant founded by Danny in early 2021. It serves three of his favorite foods: sushi, curry, and ramen. 
Despite Danny's enthusiasm for Japanese food, the diner needed help managing the basic data that had been collected over several months of operation to keep the business afloat.

This project aims to help Danny's Diner use the data it has collected to optimize its restaurant operations and improve its business performance. 
This case study focuses on analyzing customer visit patterns, analyzing customer favorite menus, and evaluating loyalty programs.
This project uses MySQL as a database management system (DBMS) to store and analyze restaurant data.

3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
